# PocketBaseball

Pocket Baseball is a game I am building as a means of diving deep into learning how to code in Python. The functions of the game are as follows:

Enter general information into the Database(Name, Team name, email). A team is generated with skills and default names then stored ina SQL DB.

From there, the game is simulated and stats for the game added to the database.

A training element will be added as well to improve the players on the teams and increase morale so the players perform better in future games.
